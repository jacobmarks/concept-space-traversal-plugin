## Concept Space Traversal Plugin


This plugin allows you to "traverse" the concept space of a similarity index
by adding text prompts (with configurable strength) to a base image.


It demonstrates how to do the following:

-   use Python and JS in the same plugin
-   create a `Panel` with custom components
-   query dataset properties from JS
-   add an SVG icon to the UI

**Note:** This plugin requires a similarity index that supports prompts (i.e.
embeds text and images) to be present on the dataset. You can create one with:

```py
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.brain as fob

dataset = fo.load_dataset("my_dataset")
fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    brain_key="my_brain_key",
    model_name="clip-vit-base32-torch",
    metric="cosine",
    )
```

## Installation

```shell
fiftyone plugins download https://github.com/jacobmarks/concept-space-traversal-plugin
```

Refer to the [main README](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins) for
more information about managing downloaded plugins and developing plugins
locally.

## Operators

### `open_traversal_panel`

-   Opens the concept space traversal panel on click
-   Only activated when the dataset has a similarity index

### `traverser`

-   Runs the Traverser on the dataset
